Language file converter for Kodi addon development

This is a modified version of https://gitlab.com/ronie/script.language-convert
which I use for my Kodi Addon development.

I made following changes:
- Fixes for Kodi 19
- Select only addons from specific authors which can be set in the addon settings
- The addon.xml is not changed anymore
- Keeping old language folders and strings.xml files for parallel development of Kodi 18/19 addons
